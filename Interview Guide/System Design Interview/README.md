This repository contains all my electronic books, which are categorized based 
on the programming languages and usability. It might be some of the books have 
copyright as most of these are downloaded from the public links (and owner of 
those books, can send email to remove that book from this repository, and I'll 
remove that one) and for personal learning only, so if anyone either downloads 
or uses this repository AS IT IS with their own responsibility.



Daily User Actions (DUA)

---

Daily User Actions (DUA) is a metric that measures the number of actions taken by users on a website or mobile app within a specific time period, typically per day. It is used to measure engagement and activity on a website or mobile app.

The calculation formula for DUA is:

```DUA = Total Number of Actions / Total Number of Days```

For example, if a website has 100,000 total actions in a month and 30 days, the DUA would be:

```DUA = 100,000 / 30 = 3,333.33```


DUA can be calculated over different time intervals such as daily, weekly or monthly. And also, it's important to consider the specific actions that you're measuring, as different actions may have different values.

|Metric|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Profile views|The number of times a user's profile is viewed|3,000|
|Posts created|The number of posts created by users|1,500|
|Comments made|The number of comments made by users|500|
|Likes given|The number of likes given by users|2,000|
|Shares made|The number of shares made by users|200|
|Direct messages sent|The number of direct messages sent by users|100|
